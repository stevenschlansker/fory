/**
 * Allocates fresh {@link BinaryRow} instances for a fixed schema. Obtained once per schema from
 * {@link Encoding#newRowFactory}. The compact format captures its schema-derived layout (offsets,
 * widths, nullability) in the factory so every {@link #newRow} call reuses it; the default format
 * builds a {@link BinaryRow} directly per call, matching {@code BinaryRowWriter#newRow}. Either way
 * the schema-evolution decode path holds one factory per historical schema, giving it the same
 * per-decode cost as the current-schema path that reads through the writer's cached layout.
