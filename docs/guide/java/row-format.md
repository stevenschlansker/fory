Apache Fory™ provides a random-access row format that enables reading nested fields from binary data without full deserialization. This drastically reduces overhead when working with large objects where only partial data access is needed.

## Overview

Row format is a cache-friendly binary random access format that supports:

- **Zero-copy access**: Read fields directly from binary without allocating objects
- **Partial deserialization**: Access only the fields you need
- **Skipping serialization**: Skip serialization of fields you don't need
- **Cross-language compatibility**: Works across Python, Java, C++, and other languages
- **Column format conversion**: Can convert to Apache Arrow columnar format automatically

## Basic Usage

```java
public class Bar {
  String f1;
  List<Long> f2;
}

public class Foo {
  int f1;
  List<Integer> f2;
  Map<String, Integer> f3;
  List<Bar> f4;
}

RowEncoder<Foo> encoder = Encoders.bean(Foo.class);

// Create large dataset
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.f1 = 10;
foo.f2 = IntStream.range(0, 1_000_000).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());
foo.f3 = IntStream.range(0, 1_000_000).boxed().collect(Collectors.toMap(i -> "k" + i, i -> i));
List<Bar> bars = new ArrayList<>(1_000_000);
for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
  Bar bar = new Bar();
  bar.f1 = "s" + i;
  bar.f2 = LongStream.range(0, 10).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());
  bars.add(bar);
}
foo.f4 = bars;

// Encode to row format (cross-language compatible with Python/C++)
BinaryRow binaryRow = encoder.toRow(foo);

// Zero-copy random access without full deserialization
BinaryArray f2Array = binaryRow.getArray(1);              // Access f2 list
BinaryArray f4Array = binaryRow.getArray(3);              // Access f4 list
BinaryRow bar10 = f4Array.getStruct(10);                  // Access 11th Bar
long value = bar10.getArray(1).getInt64(5);               // Access 6th element of bar.f2

// Name-based access without repeated schema lookups
Schema schema = encoder.schema();
Schema.Int32Field f1 = schema.int32Field("f1");
Schema.ArrayField f4 = schema.arrayField("f4");
int f1Value = f1.get(binaryRow);
ArrayData f4ByName = f4.get(binaryRow);

// Partial deserialization - only deserialize what you need
RowEncoder<Bar> barEncoder = Encoders.bean(Bar.class);
Bar bar1 = barEncoder.fromRow(f4Array.getStruct(10));     // Deserialize 11th Bar only
Bar bar2 = barEncoder.fromRow(f4Array.getStruct(20));     // Deserialize 21st Bar only

// Full deserialization when needed
Foo newFoo = encoder.fromRow(binaryRow);
```

Cache the returned `Schema.*Field` handles in user code and reuse them for all rows with the same
schema. Calling `schema.int32Field("f1")` creates a typed handle by resolving the field name to an
ordinal, accepting Java lower-camel field names for bean-derived schemas, validating the expected
row-format type, and storing the resolved ordinal. Later calls such as `f1.get(binaryRow)` go
straight to the ordinal row getter without another schema map lookup or typed handle construction.

Register any custom codecs (via `@ForyCustomCodec` or `@ForyCustomCollection`) before constructing
the first encoder for a bean that references them. Generated row codecs cache the resolved codec
in a `static final` field, so registrations made after a codec class is loaded are not picked up.

| Feature                 | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zero-Copy Access        | Read nested fields without deserializing entire object |
| Memory Efficiency       | Memory-map large datasets directly from disk           |
| Cross-Language          | Binary format compatible between Java, Python, C++     |
| Partial Deserialization | Deserialize only specific elements you need            |
| High Performance        | Skip unnecessary data parsing for analytics workloads  |

## When to Use Row Format

Row format is ideal for:

- **Analytics workloads**: When you only need to access specific fields
- **Large datasets**: When full deserialization is too expensive
- **Memory-mapped files**: Working with data larger than RAM
- **Data pipelines**: Processing data without full object reconstruction
- **Cross-language data sharing**: When data needs to be accessed from multiple languages

## Cross-Language Compatibility

Row format works seamlessly across languages. The same binary data can be accessed from:

### Python

```python
import pyfory
import pyarrow as pa
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict

@dataclass
class Bar:
    f1: str
    f2: List[pa.int64]

@dataclass
class Foo:
    f1: pa.int32
    f2: List[pa.int32]
    f3: Dict[str, pa.int32]
    f4: List[Bar]

encoder = pyfory.encoder(Foo)
binary: bytes = encoder.to_row(foo).to_bytes()

# Zero-copy access
foo_row = pyfory.RowData(encoder.schema, binary)
print(foo_row.f2[100000])
print(foo_row.f4[100000].f1)
```

### C++

```cpp
#include "fory/encoder/row_encoder.h"
#include "fory/row/writer.h"

struct Bar {
  std::string f1;
  std::vector<int64_t> f2;
  FORY_STRUCT(Bar, f1, f2);
};

struct Foo {
  int32_t f1;
  std::vector<int32_t> f2;
  std::map<std::string, int32_t> f3;
  std::vector<Bar> f4;
  FORY_STRUCT(Foo, f1, f2, f3, f4);
};

fory::row::encoder::RowEncoder<Foo> encoder;
encoder.encode(foo);
auto row = encoder.get_writer().to_row();

// Zero-copy random access
auto f2_array = row->get_array(1);
auto f4_array = row->get_array(3);
auto bar10 = f4_array->get_struct(10);
int64_t value = bar10->get_array(1)->get_int64(5);
std::string str = bar10->get_string(0);
```

## Performance Comparison

| Operation            | Object Format                 | Row Format                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Full deserialization | Allocates all objects         | Zero allocation                 |
| Single field access  | Full deserialization required | Direct offset read              |
| Memory usage         | Full object graph in memory   | Only accessed fields            |
| Suitable for         | Small objects, full access    | Large objects, selective access |

## Schema evolution

Enable `.withSchemaEvolution()` on a row, array, or map codec builder to read payloads written
by older versions of the same bean. Writing always uses the current version; reading detects
the payload's version from a strict hash at the head of the payload. Java only.

Annotate fields added after v1 with `@ForyVersion(since = N)`:

```java
@Data
public class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  @ForyVersion(since = 2)
  String email;
}
```

A v1 payload (with `name` and `age` only) decodes to a `Person` whose `email` is `null`.
Primitive fields added later default to `0`, `0.0`, or `false`. Unannotated fields are treated
as present from the first version, so a class can adopt versioning by annotating only the fields
added after v1.

For a record, the absent component's default is passed to the canonical constructor, so a
constructor that rejects `null` for a reference component added in a later version throws when
decoding an older payload. Let the constructor tolerate the missing value, for example by
normalizing `null` to a default:

```java
public record Person(String name, @ForyVersion(since = 2) String email) {
  public Person {
    if (email == null) {
      email = "";
    }
  }
}
```

Remove a field by deleting the Java member and declaring it on a nested history interface as a
method with a `@ForyVersion(until = N)`. The method's return type carries any parameterized
type information from the original field.

```java
@Data
@ForySchema(removedFields = Person.History.class)
public class Person {
  String name;

  @ForyVersion(since = 2)
  String email;

  interface History {
    @ForyVersion(until = 3)
    int age();

    @ForyVersion(until = 5)
    List<String> tags();
  }
}
```

The history method name matches the original live descriptor name. For field-backed beans
(Lombok `@Data`, records, or plain classes with a backing field) that is the field name
(`age`, `tags`). For interface beans, where the live member is a getter with no backing field,
it is the method name (`getAge`).

### Wire format and limitations

Producers and consumers must agree on the `withSchemaEvolution()` flag — they are not
wire-compatible otherwise. Row payloads always carry an 8-byte hash slot; under evolution its
value is the strict hash (which includes field name and nullability), so a flag-mismatched
peer fails loudly with `ClassNotCompatibleException`. Arrays and maps of bean elements prepend
an 8-byte strict-hash prefix under evolution and no prefix otherwise; an evolution-on consumer
reading evolution-off bytes also fails with `ClassNotCompatibleException`, but the reverse
direction (evolution-off consumer, evolution-on bytes) is undefined.

To adopt the flag on an existing deployment, enable `withSchemaEvolution()` on both sides in a
release that changes no schema, then start evolving schemas only once every peer is on the
evolution-enabled build. Turning the flag on and changing a schema in the same release strands
any peer that has not yet upgraded.

Cross-language consumers (Python, C++) cannot read evolution-enabled payloads.

A reader selects the matching layout from the 8-byte strict hash on the payload. The hash includes
field names and nullability and is checked for collisions across a bean's own versions when the
codec is built, but it is still a 64-bit value: a payload whose hash coincides with one of the
reader's historical layouts is decoded against that layout. This is the same hash-based dispatch
the row format has always used, so feeding a codec bytes it was not built for has undefined results
whether or not evolution is enabled. Only hand a codec payloads produced for the same bean.

Nested evolution works to arbitrary depth and places no restriction on shape: a versioned bean
may contain versioned beans that themselves contain versioned beans, the same versioned bean
class may back more than one field, and fields typed as a non-evolving bean, a list, or a map are
unrestricted. Each nesting level is routed to the correct historical layout. A versioned bean may
be used as a map key as well as a map value, and the key and value evolve independently. This
holds wherever the map appears: as the codec's top-level type, nested inside a bean field, or
reached through a top-level array or map (such as `List<Map<KeyBean, ValueBean>>`), and a single
map may evolve more than one distinct bean class across its key and value. A top-level map carries
its own hash identifying both layouts together; a map nested inside an array, another map, or a
bean field has its layouts folded into the enclosing payload's hash.

When a versioned bean contains other versioned beans, the reader can read one projection layout per
combination of versions across the composition. A reader compiles a combination's codec the first
time it decodes a payload at that combination, so the cost tracks the historical versions you
actually receive, not the number you could in principle define. A map whose key and value both
evolve combines their versions the same way. Retiring an entry from a bean's `History` interface
once you no longer read payloads from that range stops the reader from accepting those payloads; it
is purely a read-side decision, and the writer always uses the current schema.

With `@ForyGenerate(evolution = true)`, every combination is materialised as a class file at build
time instead of compiled on first decode, so the cross-product becomes the full set of generated
classes. Retiring `History` entries you no longer read bounds that set.

### GraalVM native image

The runtime evolution path uses Janino to compile a projection codec on the first decode of a
non-current peer hash, and native-image builds have no Janino on the image classpath, so a peer-hash
miss fails at runtime. Native-image consumers of `withSchemaEvolution()` must precompile every
projection combination at build time with `@ForyGenerate(evolution = true)`. With every combination
materialised as a class file, the runtime stable-name probe finds the projection codec without
invoking Janino. Same-version round-trips (writer schema hash equals the reader's current hash)
never reach Janino even without precompilation; only a peer that wrote against a different schema
version does.
